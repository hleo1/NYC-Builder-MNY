## üìñ About This Game

NYC Builder 2025 is an educational arcade game that makes NYC housing policy interactive and entertaining. Players control a building that must survive against three different legal challenges‚ÄîArticle 78, FAR (Floor Area Ratio), and Member Deference‚Äîeach representing real NYC housing laws that affect development.

This game embodies Maximum New York's philosophy: **civics education should be entertaining and outcompete Netflix**. Instead of dry policy documents, experience firsthand how different laws impact housing development through fast-paced gameplay.

## üèõÔ∏è About Maximum New York

[Maximum New York](https://www.maximumnewyork.com/about) is a new civics academy focused on **governmental mechanics**‚Äîthe study of the components of government and law, and how they interrelate. 

**Mission:** Far too few people understand how NYC's government works, and there is no academy to teach them. MNY combats this through intensive, robust education on NYC's governmental systems, with special attention to case studies and political history.

**What Makes MNY Different:**
- Trains a smaller group to a very high level, creating deep knowledge and expertise
- Focuses on individuals who can push big, vital projects through NYC
- Students meet co-founders, employers/employees, and best friends‚Äîthe social graph is part of the value
- Emphasizes that civic instruction must be **entertaining** and **good**

### The Laws

1. **‚öñÔ∏è Article 78** - *The Slowdown Law*
   - Represents legal challenges that slow down development
   - Each contact with this law makes your building move slower
   - Survive for 30 seconds without being completely frozen!

2. **üìê FAR (Floor Area Ratio)** - *The Shrinker*
   - Represents zoning restrictions that limit building size
   - Each contact shrinks your building
   - Keep at least some of your building intact for 30 seconds!

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Member Deference** - *The Unbeatable Law...?*
   - Represents the most restrictive housing policy
   - One touch and it's game over
   - But wait... there might be a way to fight back with Proposition 4!

## üéì Educational Philosophy

This game follows Maximum New York's core principle: **civics education must be entertaining and compete with Netflix**. As MNY founder Daniel Golliher notes:

> "Civics already has a bad reputation as a boring field. But this isn't the fault of the field‚Äîit's the fault of generations of terrible teachers. Good political and civic instruction requires outcompeting Netflix."

This game makes housing policy:
- **Interactive** - Experience laws through gameplay, not reading
- **Memorable** - Learn through doing and failing
- **Shareable** - Easy to spread and discuss
- **Accessible** - No prior knowledge required

## üó≥Ô∏è Take Action & Learn More

This game is inspired by real NYC housing policies. To deepen your understanding:

**Learn Governmental Mechanics:**
- Take a [Maximum New York class](https://www.maximumnewyork.com/classes) to understand how NYC government really works
- Learn the hierarchy of authorities, case studies on municipal transformation, and practical political action
- Network with technologists, city employees, legislative staffers, and engaged citizens

**Get Involved in Housing:**

**Why MNY's Approach Matters:**
As Daniel Golliher writes, "If you've ever had the thought 'people are too apathetic to learn this,' you are probably blaming others for your own inability to relay the material in a compelling fashion. The call of civics is a call of excellence."

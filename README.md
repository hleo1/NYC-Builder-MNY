## üìñ About

NYC Builder 2025 is an educational arcade game that demonstrates how different NYC housing laws can impact building development. Players control a building and must navigate three different legal challenges, each representing a real NYC housing law that affects development.

### The Laws

1. **‚öñÔ∏è Article 78** - *The Slowdown Law*
   - Represents legal challenges that slow down development
   - Each contact with this law makes your building move slower
   - Survive for 30 seconds without being completely frozen!

2. **üìê FAR (Floor Area Ratio)** - *The Shrinker*
   - Represents zoning restrictions that limit building size
   - Each contact shrinks your building
   - Keep at least some of your building intact for 30 seconds!

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Member Deference** - *The Unbeatable Law...?*
   - Represents the most restrictive housing policy
   - One touch and it's game over
   - But wait... there might be a way to fight back with Proposition 4!
